This is a Shop microservice app currently being developed to learn and practise **RabbitMQ** and microservices as a whole.  
I am using **Node.js**, **Typescript**, **Express**, **SQL** & **Sequelize** for the development.  
Also, I plan to use **Docker**, **RPC** and **CI/CD**.  
I will include all the required **authentication** & **validation** later as they are not the main goal of this application.
