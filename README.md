This is a Shop microservice app currently being developed.
I will be using **Node.js**, **Typescript**, **Express**, **SQL** & **Sequelize**.  
I plan to use **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** for communication.  
Also, I will use **Docker**, **RPC** and **CI/CD**.  
I will include all the required **Authentication** & **validation**.

## Current setup
